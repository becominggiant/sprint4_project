Project Title: Car Listings Analysis

--Description--

This project is a tool to analyze car listings data and visualize various aspects such as price distribution, model year distribution, odometer readings, and more. It uses Streamlit for the web interface and Plotly Express for the visualizations.

--Features--

- Histograms: Visualize distributions for price, model year, odometer readings, and days listed.
- Scatter Plots: Show relationships between price and other variables such as odometer, model year, and cylinders.
- Bar Plots: Display the number of listings by condition, fuel type, and transmission type.
- Box Plots: Compare price distributions by condition, fuel type, and transmission type.
- Correlation Matrix: Heatmap to show correlations between numeric variables.
- Scatter Matrix: Scatter matrix plot to visualize relationships between multiple variables.


--Methods and Libraries Used--

- Streamlit: Used for creating the web application.
- Plotly Express: Used for creating interactive plots and charts.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis
